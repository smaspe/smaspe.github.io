Once in a while, you stumble upon an article like this. [Hardest Problem in Computer Science: Centering Things - Tonsky](https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/).

It contains all you need to know to realize that, centering things is much, much harder than you thought.
There are so many moving pieces, it's no wonder no-one seems to get it right.

Anyway. I regularly refer to this article, so I figured I'd keep a link to it somewhere.
