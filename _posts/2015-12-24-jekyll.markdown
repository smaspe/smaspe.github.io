The first post, because there has to be one, to announce that there will be content here some day (soon, I hope). For obvious reasons of simplicity, those pages are generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), hosted on github pages, and are now using the default theme.

The content from the previous blog will be ported here ([this one](https://smaspe.wordpress.com)).

Also, new articles, when there is time for that. A few words on how and why the [functional iterables](https://github.com/smaspe/FunctionalIterables), as well as the detailed process to publish such a library on jCenter. May be more!

Next year, though.
