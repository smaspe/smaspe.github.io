- `void` is not a type
- functions type is not accessible easily
- operators are not functions
- primitives
- `List` is broken

# How other languages do it

## Python

- no such thing
- operators are shorthand for functions
- Functions are a type
- no such things
- list is morea combination of iterable and subscriptable

## JavaScript

It's weird. But function is a type like others
