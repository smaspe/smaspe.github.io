I am not a morning person. But why sleep when the sun is up?

I decided to try and follow the rythm of the sun. Somehow it seems to make more sense than arbitrary times like we have, that on top of that change twice half way through the year for no apparent reason.

Enters the [sun clock](link to the play store goes here), which tells you:
- When the sun rises
- When you should go to bed to get a good night sleep and get up with the sun

Typically, here in Montreal, in summer it means getting up at 5am, and going to bed at 9pm, shortly after the sunset. In winter, getting up at 7:30am, going to bed around 11:30pm.

This way, you maximise the time spent awake during the day. And it is all progressive, and it does not care about daylight saving time.

And you don't even need curtains!

All you have to do is choose what is the duration of your night (I need at least a good 8h sleep, but ymmv), and how long after sunrise you want to get up. Choose if you want to see the sun rise everyday, or let the sun light gently wake you.
