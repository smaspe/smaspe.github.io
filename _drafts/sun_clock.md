I am not a morning person. But why sleep when the sun is up?

Enters the sun clock, which tells you:
- When the sun rises
- When you should go to bed to get a good night sleep and get up with the sun

Typically, here in Montreal, in summer it means getting up at 5am, and going to bed at 9pm, shortly after the sunset. In winter, getting up at 7:30am, going to bed around 11:30pm.

This way, you maximise the time spent awake during the day. And it is all progressive, and it does not care about daylight saving time.

All you have to do is choose what is the duration of your night, and how long after sunrise you want to get up.
