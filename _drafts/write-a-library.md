# So you want to write a library?
There are a few questions you should be asking yourself

## What
What library. What does it do, why is it different/more relevant than existing libraries, how is it useful to other people. Jesse Wilson said during one of his presentations that you should not write yet another json parsing library. But then he presented moshi.

## Who
Everyone. Companies, individuals, hobbyist, students...

## Why
Why are you writing a library? Here a few good reasons, that apply differently depending on who you are:
- Better separation of concern in your code
- Possibility of peer review
- Open source is cool. It can be a part of your port-folio, or carry a positive image for a company.
- Give back something to the community. You probably have dozens of open-source libraries in your projects.
- Make that part of your code a product so it gets the QA attention it deserves
- Make it easier to reuse in other projects

## When
How do you know when it is time to write a library?
- When there is a component that naturally emerges from your code, and it starts to look like it has a personality
- When you architecture your project, and realize that one of the module is really independent of the rest

## How
There are a few things to do in order to ensure your library is in good shape to put out there.
- Open sourcing it
- Testing it
- Making sure you test it (coverage)
- Publish it
