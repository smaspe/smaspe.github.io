As mentioned in a [previous article]({% post_url 2016-02-15-publish-a-library %}), writing and publishing an open-source library is good for a lot of reasons.

There are a few things to do in order to make sure the publication of your library makes sense, here is how to do that in Java.

# Open sourcing
My library is [here](https://github.com/smaspe/FunctionalIterables). The issues are public and anyone can add one.

The shields on the readme page also indicate the public status of the testing, code coverage, and publication.

# Testing
jUnit + CI

# Coverage
code cov integration

# Publication
jCenter + plugin

// TODO detail those steps illustrating with how it works for jCenter/java/android
